# 4. Create a project

When testing features and services make sure to always stop them when done to ensure you're not billed unnecessarily.

Once you have a free trial and have upgraded to the paid plan (with Google's credit) you have access to all premium tier services and features.

- create a project:
    - visit https://console.cloud.google.com/project
    - create project name
    - set a project ID (needs to be unique across GCP)
    - select App Engine location - default location for where app instances spin up
- when a project is selected, all services started from then on will be under that project
